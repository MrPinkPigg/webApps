	<h1>Assignment 1: Duplicate Me!</h1>
	
	<p>
		For this assignment, you are to follow these instructions to duplicate what you see here as a web page. For example, the text above is the largest header you can create using a normal HTML tag. For this assignment, you will only need basic tags, without attributes, so no fancy stuff! Also, everything should be hand coded in a text editor. If I see the telltale junk that web design software puts in, then it will not be a satisfactory homework. <br> <b><em>This is strong & emphasized text</em></b>
	</p>

	<h2>OMG this is totally the 2nd biggest header. YES!</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Here we have an unordered list</li>
		<li>I supposeI can note at this time that while you should have al the text I have, the font doesn't have to be identical, since it depends on your system</li>
	</ul>

	This haiku uses <br> line breaks to separate the <br> lines. Totally rad.
	
<br><br>

	<b><table>
		<tr><td>this</td><td>is</td></tr>
		<tr><td>a</td><td>table</td></tr>
		<tr><td>it</td><td>has</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>rows</td></tr>
	</table></b>

<br><br>

	Even though there are no lines between cells, the 4 lines above are in a table. Ok! Well that was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...easy?
